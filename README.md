# Data-Driven-Motion-Planning

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for a four-wheeled toy car with non-holonomic constraints, as it navigates through corridor and box environments using real-time sensor data collected through laser scanning. This approach is referred to as "Data-Driven Motion Planning."
